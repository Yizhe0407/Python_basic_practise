# Self-study Python in summer vacation

## Introduction
Month 1:
In this month, I plan to focus on learning the basic syntax and core concepts of Python. I will start with writing simple code to learn how to use variables, data types, and basic operators. To control the program flow, I will learn about if-elif-else conditional statements and how to use for and while loops. Additionally, I will delve into understanding function definition and calling, and learn how to use parameters and return values.

Furthermore, I will explore different data structures in Python, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Understanding their features and usage will help me organize and manipulate data more effectively. Moreover, I will learn how to read and write files, which will be crucial in handling data in the future.

Month 2:
Entering the second month, if I have already mastered the basic syntax and core concepts of Python, I will focus on implementing various projects to enhance my programming skills.

I plan to apply the knowledge gained earlier through more hands-on projects. These projects can cover various domains, such as web applications, web scraping, and more. Through these practical projects, I will learn how to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems and refine my logical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
